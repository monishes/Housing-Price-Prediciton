# Housing-Price-Prediciton
Predicting the Housing Prices using Machine Learning Regression Models using the Boston House-Price datset.

This Project predicts the Housing Prices according to various factors such as Crime Rate, Number of Rooms, Size, Tax rate etc.

This project uses the Boston House-Price Datset of Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. 'Hedonic
 prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management,
 vol.5, 81-102, 1978.   Used in Belsley, Kuh & Welsch, 'Regression diagnostics
 ...', Wiley, 1980.
 
 After training and testing 5 Different Regression models, The Random Forest Regression model had the highest Accuracy of 88.77%.
 The Accuracy of the remaining models are as follows :
 
 1. Random Forest Regression : 88.77%
 2. Polynomial Regression (Degree 2) : 84.28%
 3. Support Vector Regression : 82.80%
 4. Decision Tree Regression : 74.67%
 5. Multiple Linear Regression : 73.51%
 
 Libraries Used : sklearn, numpy, pandas
